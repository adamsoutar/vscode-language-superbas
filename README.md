# language-superbas

**A VS Code plugin providing syntax-highlighting for SuperBAS**

Syntax highlighting for [adamsoutar/SuperBAS](https://github.com/adamsoutar/SuperBAS)

Being a TextMate grammar, this shouldn't be too hard to port to other editors like Atom if you're interested. At the moment, I'm trying out VS Code (despite prefering Atom), so that's what I wrote it for.

## Installing

`language-superbas` isn't on the extension marketplace yet. For now, you can install it with:
